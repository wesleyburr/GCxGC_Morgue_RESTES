# GCxGC_Morgue_RESTES

Code for analysis of GCxGC data from Morgue+RESTES decomposition study. Darshil Patil, PhD candidate at UQTR, under Dr. Shari Forbes, ran a number of experiments gathering headspace observations from decomposition of human remains, for the question of "VOC Profile of the post-mortem period". 

This code is a set of routines which work with the exported "hit list" from the LECO software environment, as StatCompare was not compatible with the Pegasus equipment used for these observations. In this code, we organize, collate, normalize and synchronize the observations from the large number of GCxGC observations, to provide useful inputs for analysis via clustering algorithms, e.g., PCA.
